00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Wait, let's see if we can take it off.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.500
Look, hold on.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500
Give it a little crank because it has so many gears.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.000
So either you have to do something with the gears inside.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.400
Remove a little bit of gears.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.600
Make it so there's not a lot of torque.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.700
But make it a little bit faster, you know what I mean?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.400
So you're going to have to start playing with the—

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.800
—the combination of the gears inside.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.500
Because it gets stuck right there.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.300
So either you lose a little bit of the—

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.000
—the rim.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.200
Or find wheels that are not too heavy.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.700
So we can keep that momentum going.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.000
Alright, well we know one works. The other one at the moment does not work.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.500
So we soldered the other connection.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.000
But the right-side motor works.
